# Instructions
## RX-Series Automaton Quick Start Guide

### Welcome To Your New RX-Series!

Congratulations on the purchase of your new RX-Series Automaton!
In addition to its unparalleled power, extensibility, and reliability, the new RX-Series Automaton has been designed for ease of use.
With a little bit of regular maintenance, you and your family will be able to enjoy the benefits of automated labor for generations to come!

### Activation

The RX-Series is equipped with a voice-activation module.
To begin the power-on sequence, simply speak the unit's designation followed by the command phrase "activate."

*Note:*

1. The unit's designation can be found etched into the plate located on the front of the unit.
2. Speak loudly!
   If the unit's battery has been fully drained, the voice recognition microphone will be running at very low power.

### Operation

The unit should understand and obey voice commands.

Should manual override ever become necessary, the directional pad can be used to move the automaton around.
The X button will open a menu that will allow you to choose from the available set of installed peripherals, and the O button will activate the currently selected attachment.

### Standard Attachments

*Manipuators* - The RX-Series is equipped with a strong set of manipulators to lift and carry heavy loads.
From lifting boulders to uprooting saplings, the RX-Series can do it all!

*Rotary Saw*- Cut through the toughest tree trunks and logs with this self-straightening, extremely durable saw.

*Pneumatic Shovel*- With this powerful shovel, your RX-Series automaton can dig more in a day than a hundred men could dig in a  week!
Dig holes, cut trenches, and even pry old tree stumps out of the ground.
